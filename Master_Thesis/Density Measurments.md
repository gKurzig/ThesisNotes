## Simple Case for a solid
For a Solid the simples way to measure the density is the measure its weight using a scale and measure its Volume. For an regularly shaped body e.g a cube one can just measure the side and gets the volume. Those measurments are easily tracable. That means that those measurments are directly linked to the definition of the SI standart units. [Tracbility](Traceability)
For an unevenly shaped solid, determining the volume one can submerge the solid into a liquid and measure how much liquid is replaced. In bouth cases one measure volume and mass with 2 diffend methods but bouth are comparasons with SI units.


# Liquids

### Pycnometer 
A pyknometer is a well defined volume that can be filled with a liquid and can be weight. Basicaly it is just a very precises balance pan. 

The Measure the density of a liquid the as for a Solid can be done. A well defined volume of the liquid is placed on a scale. this directly allows to measure the density. This is called Pyknometer. 

### **Areometers**
Are simple density measurment Tool that consist of a hollow glasstube filled with some weight. When Tiped into a liquid it sinkes until its boujance force is equal the
