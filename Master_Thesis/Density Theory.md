The Density is defined as 
$$
\rho = \frac{m}{V}
$$
It is a basic pyhsical material property. Its units are$\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$. 


The Density temperatur and pressure dependent.
Especially when working with fluid the depentance of temperatur and pressure is importat. According to the ideal Gas law the following formular describes the connection between

If differend materials are mixed the density of the mixture can be callculaded with the following formular.

$$\rho = \frac{1}{V}* \sum_{i}m_{i}   $$

In case of a mixture of only 2 substances the density is enouth to get the rations between the 2 substances. In case of a multi substance mixture it can still provide a pice of information to find the ratios but it is not enouth alone.
