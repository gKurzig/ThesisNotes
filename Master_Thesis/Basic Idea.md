## Archimedes principal

A body submergeded into a fluid expereiences a boujancy fource equal to the weight of the sorounding liquid. The weight of the surraounding Liquid is its density $\rho_{L}$ times the volume of the displaced liquid
$$F_{B}= \rho_{L}*V*g
$$


When a volume is placed on a scale the forces are 
$$
F_{scale} = F_{gravity}-F_{Bouyacy}
$$

$$
F_{scale} = m*g-\rho_{gas} * V*g
$$
$$
F_{scale} = m*g-\rho_{gas} * V
$$
