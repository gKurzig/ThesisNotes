ABSTRACT
```
```
The Federal Institute of Metrology METAS developed a Hydrogen Field Test Standard (HFTS) that can be used for
field verification and calibration of hydrogen refuelling stations. The testing method is based on the gravimetric
principle. The experimental design of the HFTS as well as the description of the method are presented here. The
HFTS has been tested at METAS with nitrogen gas at  40 �C to mimic a refuelling process in the field. Laboratory
tests have shown that icing on the pipes of the HFTS have a non-negligible impact on the results. Field-testing
with the HFTS has also been performed at the Empa hydrogen refuelling station with hydrogen at up to 70
MPa. The major uncertainty components have been identified and assigned values. The required expanded
uncertainty of 0.3% could be achieved. A detailed uncertainty budget has been presented and shows that the
scale is the largest contributor; buoyancy corrections only play a minor role. For the lowest uncertainty mea-
surements, appropriate waiting times or cleaning methods to get rid of icing are required.
**1. Introduction**

A large hydrogen infrastructure is currently in development across
Europe. The industry faces the dilemma that they are required to meet
certain measurement requirements set by legislation that currently
cannot be followed due to the lack of available methods and standards.
One important metrological challenge is the accurate measurement of
the amount of delivered hydrogen during refuelling.
From the perspective of an end user, hydrogen refuelling stations
look and operate in a very similar way to petrol stations, the only dif-
ference being that the delivered amount is given in kg. The SAE J
[1] establishes the protocol and process limits for hydrogen fuelling of
light duty vehicles so that the vehicle storage tanks don’t overheat or
overfill. Vehicles are typically refuelled with precooled hydrogen gas
from dispensers within 3 min–5 min from banks of pressurized cylinders.
Fuel delivery temperature, the maximum fuel flow rate, the rate of


pressure increase and the ending pressure are all parameters that are
defined by process limits and are affected by ambient temperature, fuel
delivery temperature and initial pressure in the vehicle’s hydrogen tank.
During a fill, temperature and pressure span wide ranges: pressure can
go from 0.1 MPa up to a nominal working pressure of 70 MPa; to allow
short filling times, hydrogen can be precooled down to  40 �C. Mass
flow is determined by a pressure-ramp rate (PRR) that depend on initial
pressure, available volume and temperature. We are thus far from steady
conditions and only limited studies of high pressure hydrogen flow
meters under transient conditions have been performed [2,3].
International requirements propose accuracies for meters used in
hydrogen refuelling station [4] and only very limited studies have been
performed on how to test, inspect and verify such systems under labo-
ratory conditions and in the field.
In the EMPIR Metrology for Hydrogen Vehicles (MetroHyVe) project,
this is addressed through the development of several mobile gravimetric

standards for field verification as well as an investigation into the use of
substitute fluids for laboratory testing or calibration of flow meters used
in hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS). In the gravimetric method, the
dispensed mass is determined by weighing the amount of delivered
hydrogen collected in a pressure vessel on a scale. We chose the gravi-
metric method because it is an established method that should be
capable of achieving the required expanded uncertainty of 0.3%, one
fifth of the proposed requirement of 1.5% Maximum Permissible Error
(MPE) for flow meters.
In the course of the MetroHyVe project, three field test standards are
being developed by members of the consortium: Justervesenet, METAS
and VSL while CESAME Exadebit is using a standard built by Air Liquide.
In this work, we constructed a Hydrogen Field Test Standard certified
for measurements in an environment with explosive atmosphere and
performed measurements in the laboratory using nitrogen gas cooled
down to  40 �C to mimic real conditions as encountered in a HRS. The
major uncertainty components have been identified and assigned
values. The required expanded uncertainty of 0.3% could be achieved
and field-testing with hydrogen confirmed the laboratory results.

**2. Experimental design**

_2.1.Mechanical design_

The METAS Hydrogen Field Test Standard (HFTS) consists of two 36
L pressure tanks mounted into an aluminium frame. The tanks are type 4
cylinders (carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy with a plastic liner) with a
service pressure of 70 MPa (at 15 �C), corresponding to a capacity of
1.44 kg H 2 each. The nominal empty mass of each tank is 33 kg with
dimensions of 320.8 mm �910.3 mm. Fig. 1 shows the HFTS in its frame
resting on its aluminium base plate (1900 mm � 1000 mm). The total
weight is around 400 kg. The HFTS alone weighs around 150 kg.
The HFTS is equipped with two 27 cm long Pt 100 probes inserted at
one end of each tank and two digital pressure transducers with a 100
MPa range. Additional Pt 100 probes are mounted on the HFTS to
monitor temperature in the tubing and around the scale. Passive pres-
sure gauges are also mounted before the tanks. A Coriolis mass flow
meter is also part of the HFTS and can be placed in series with the piping
leading to the tanks for monitoring or eventual calibration purposes.
The frame is mounted on a 300 kg scale with 0.1 g resolution for
gravimetric measurements. The weight of the frame can be lifted from
the scale by a load removal system activated by a hand pump. The
complete system (HFTS þscale) is placed on an aluminium base plate,
which can be lifted with a forklift and placed into a van or on a trailer for
transport.
Accompanying the HFTS are a secondary ESD plastic frame to protect
the scale from the environment (shown in Fig. 2), a mobile data

```
acquisition system with laptop and a 4 m tall stainless steel vent stack
with support for venting the hydrogen gas in the field after a fill. During
transport, the HFTS’s load is removed from the scale and held in place by
locking nuts. A detailed description of the operating instructions is part
of the internal documentation of the HFTS.
```
```
2.2.Flow scheme
```
```
Fig. 3 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) of the
HFTS. The system is composed of three lines: an inlet line connected to
the hydrogen dispenser, a purge line to flush the system with N 2 and an
outlet line for blowing the tanks down. The components located in the
blue box are part of the frame that is being weighed on the scale. The
hydrogen from the dispenser enters the HFTS through a nozzle as
mounted on a car and is guided into the tanks. The gas can pass through
the Coriolis mass flow meter, depending on the position of the needle
valves V-4, V-1 and V-5. After filling, the tanks are emptied through a
vent stack after passing through a cascade of pressure reducing valves
PR-1 and PR-2 located after the needle valve V-9.
The base plate accommodates the piping for the load removal system
(in red in Fig. 3) as well as the piping for flushing and purging the tanks
of all hydrogen gas before transport. Several nozzles placed around the
frame allow flooding the ESD housing with an inert gas during the
measurements to prevent eventual icing on the pipes.
All the piping in contact with hydrogen is made of medium pressure
¼" tubing, NPT and FK series fittings and valves in 316-stainless steel.
```
```
2.3.Electrical scheme and data acquisition
```
```
The HFTS will store high-pressure hydrogen during field-testing and
is therefore considered as equipment in an environment with explosive
atmosphere (ATEX Zone 2). This puts some constraints on the design of
the electrical scheme and data acquisition (DAQ) system as well as on
the choice of sensors.
Fig. 4 shows the electrical scheme of the HFTS. The components in
the coloured part are located in the explosive atmosphere zone and are
all certified. This includes the temperature probes, the pressure sensors,
the scale and the Coriolis mass flow meter. These last two instruments
are considered as non-arcing and are connected to the DAQ system
through their own transmitters or readout modules. The remaining
sensors are connected through terminal boxes to safety barriers located
in the DAQ rack outside the ATEX Zone. An earth monitoring system (in
yellow in Fig. 4) guarantees that the HFTS and its DAQ system are
continuously grounded with the hydrogen refuelling station to prevent

electrostatic charges as ignition sources.
The DAQ system is shown in Fig. 5 and acquires data from the scale
and the temperature and pressure sensors. All cables can be plugged or
unplugged from the HFTS to eliminate torqueing of the scale during
weighing. The Coriolis mass flow meter is connected through a dedi-
cated transmitter that is part of the DAQ system but read out using
dedicated software from the manufacturer.

**3. Description of the method**

The HFTS is used to measure the mass of gas delivered into a vehicle.
The method will be presented here.
The dispensed mass into the HFTS is calculated by:

_mH_ 2 ¼ _m_ 2  _m_ 1 (1)

```
where m is the true mass and the subscripts denote the mass of the HFTS
before and after the filling, respectively. The mass indicated by the scale
needs to be buoyancy corrected and for that we need the volume of the
tank and of the frame.
The HFTS tank volume is a function of pressure and temperature and
is given by:
```
## Vtank ¼ V 0 ⋅ð 1 þ3 ⋅ α ⋅ ΔT Þ⋅ð 1 þ λ ⋅ ΔP Þ (2)

```
where V 0 ¼ 59 : 5 L is the external tank volume at ambient conditions
```
## with no internal pressure, α ¼ 2 : 0 ⋅ 10 ^6 �C^1 the linear thermal expan-

```
sion coefficient, λ ¼ 2 : 2 ⋅ 10 ^10 Pa^1 the pressure expansion coefficient,
ΔT and ΔP are the difference of the temperature and pressure from the
reference values, respectively. If we take into account a maximum
temperature difference of 80 �C, one obtains a volume correction factor
of 1.00048. The pressure expansion coefficient has been determined
experimentally during a refuelling up to 70 MPa and from manufac-
turer’s data. The thermal and pressure expansion coefficients are very
similar to values published elsewhere [3] and have been assigned an
uncertainty of 10% (k ¼1). Taking a maximum pressure difference of
87.5 MPa gives a correction factor of 1.01925. Thermal expansion will
be completely neglected in the remaining description of the method as
its correction factor is much smaller compared to the pressure correc-
tion. The external volume of the tank has been given an uncertainty of 5
L (k ¼1). The volume of the frame has been determined using the CAD
drawing of the HTFS (70 L) and has been assigned an uncertainty of 5 L
(k ¼1).
From Equations (1) and (2), we can now calculate the dispensed mass
into the HFTS corrected for buoyancy and apparent mass reading from
the scale:

## are the densities of air and stainless steel at reference conditions, ρair is

the density of the air around the scale and the tanks before and after the
fill and is calculated using the formula by Giacomo [5].
To obtain a feeling for orders of magnitude, a complete fill in the
HFTS corresponds to 2.9 kg of hydrogen gas in the tanks at a pressure of
70 MPa. This yields a volume expansion of 0.92 L for each tank. Under
identical ambient conditions before and after the fill, we obtain a
buoyancy correction of 2.12 g (0.08%) for both tanks. The term due to
the volume of the frame only plays a role if ambient conditions change.
Laboratory tests were performed to reproduce field tests as closely as
possible. The aim was to elaborate a testing procedure and practice
using the HFTS before going into the field. The same procedure has then
been used for the field measurements.
All laboratory measurements were performed with nitrogen gas from
a bundle as a 5.5 MPa gas source to fill the HFTS. Before entering the
HFTS, the gas was cooled down to  40 �C by a heat exchanger to
reproduce the temperature conditions of hydrogen as delivered by a
HRS. Pressure and temperature in the tanks was monitored continuously
during the fill. The frame was always enclosed or partially enclosed by
the housing, the latter geometry leads to a better air circulation around
the scale.
To perform the measurements, we followed several steps:

1. Disconnect all the cables and hoses from the frame, lower the HFTS
    onto the scale and weigh the empty HFTS, record the ambient
    conditions
2. Lift the HFTS from the scale, connect all sensors and measure tank
    pressure and temperature as well as temperature of the air in the
    frame
3. Connect the gas source to the HFTS inlet and fill the tanks. During the
    fill, all sensors are monitoring and recording data.
4. Disconnect all the cables and hoses from the frame and lower the
    HFTS onto the scale
5. Wait until scale reading stabilises and record value
6. Lift the HFTS from the scale and connect all sensors. Connect the vent
    stack and blow down the gas.
**4. Laboratory results**

Typical results for the pressure rate and temperature profiles for a fill
up to 4 MPa are shown in Fig. 6. The pressure ramp rate (PRR) during the
fill is around 1.14 MPa/min. During this period, temperature in the
tanks increased due to compression heating while temperature of the
tubing decreased below the freezing point of water due to the cold ni-
trogen gas flow. The air temperature around the scale remains constant.
After the fill, all temperatures converge slowly toward the current
ambient condition.
Fig. 7 shows the temperature profile around the scale starting 60 s
after the fill during 1 h with the HFTS housing closed. Due to the tem-
perature increase in the tanks, heat is transferred to the air around the
scale, which then returns to ambient temperature after around 40 min.
This can be considered as a worst case because of the poor air circulation
around the HFTS and yields a maximum drift of 0.3 �C.
The cold gas flowing through the HFTS causes part of the humidity
present around the HFTS to condense and freeze on the pipes. This
quantity of ice will be weighed but should not be part of the determi-
nation of the mass of dispensed gas. Fig. 8 shows the scale reading

```
profile shortly after the fill with a closed and a partially closed housing
(opening of 25 cm). We notice an increase in mass due to condensation
that reaches a maximum before a slow decrease because of melting and
evaporation, eventually reaching a constant scale value. The maximum
quantity of lost mass seems to be independent of the position of the
housing and amounts to more or less 7 g in our case.

This is by far not negligible. On a brighter side, closing the housing
partially accelerates the loss of mass and leads to a stable scale value
with less than 1 g of spread after approximately 30 min.
We also performed similar measurements with a closed housing
flooded with nitrogen or argon gas. We chose argon because it is heavier
than air and filled the housing up to the top and remained in the housing,
contrary to nitrogen. With both gases, we still observed icing on the
pipes but less than with air. Flooding with an inert gas brings more
unknowns in the buoyancy correction because the flooding level is not
well defined. In addition, the amount of gas needed is quite large.
It looks like the best solution is to measure with a partially closed
housing, cleaning/drying the pipes after the fill and wait for the scale to
show a stable value.

**5. Field results**

The field tests were conducted at the Empa hydrogen refuelling
station in the same manner as the laboratory tests except that the HFTS
was filled according to the SAE J2601 protocol with precooled hydrogen
down to  40 �C, which implies that the PRR was much higher (~
MPa/min), and the ambient conditions were not controlled. All mea-
surements took place in July and the average air temperature at noon
was around 36 �C. Fig. 9 shows the HFTS mounted on a trailer next to the
Empa hydrogen dispenser. The data-acquisition system (DAQ) is
installed in the van and connected through the blue cables to the HFTS.
The vent stack can be identified in the back. A safety cordon delimits the
area.
Typical results for the pressure rate and temperature profiles for a fill
up to 70 MPa are shown in Fig. 10. One observes a very similar
behaviour to what was observed in Fig. 6 under laboratory conditions
with cold nitrogen. One identifies the pressure burst to check for po-
tential leaks before the pressure ramps up continuously up to a little
more than 70 MPa. The temperature in the tubing decreases immedi-
ately because of the cold hydrogen flowing in it and reaches a constant
value of  28 �C. The temperature in the pressure vessels increases
quickly during the beginning of fill up to 60 �C and then increases
steadily to 70 �C. The air temperature around the scale during the fill
drops by about 0.3 �C. The exterior of the pipes and valves leading from
the nozzle to the pressure tanks are covered in a thin layer of ice due to
condensation of the humidity on the cold stainless steel.
During the fill and until before the weighing, the housing was
partially opened to allow for a better air circulation and accelerate the
evaporation of the ice on the pipes. After a weighting time of about 25
min, the remaining humidity, in the form of a thin layer of water, was
removed from the pipes and valves using a dry cloth. The housing was
then lowered to its lowest position and some additional time allowed the
scale to stabilise. The spread in the scale indication of 1 g was confirmed

```
in these field measurements.

The scale has a resolution of 0.1 g and was calibrated against METAS
standard F2 class masses with the frame on the scale in the range (0–4)
kg in 0.5 kg steps to cover the maximum mass of hydrogen filling. We
observed a maximum deviation of 0.5 g, taking into account repeat-
ability. The calibration was checked over time and the scale showed a
drift of 0.4 g over 90 min. The scale will always be calibrated on site in
the field during measurements. To take into account the effect of field
use, we consider a conservative uncertainty value of 0.7 g (k ¼1) for the
scale.
Air density depends mainly on the parameters pressure, temperature
and humidity. These quantities are continuously logged with un-
certainties of 50 Pa, 0.3 �C and 5%, respectively and allow the deter-
mination of air density with an uncertainty of 0.15% (k ¼1) during
measurements.
The digital pressure transducers have a resolution 2 kPa and a long-
term stability of 100 kPa according to the specifications. The sensors
have been calibrated and shown to lie within the specifications of 200
kPa.
Table 1 presents a summary of the uncertainty components and their
magnitude for the gravimetric method for a test collection of 1 kg of gas.
As expected, the scale is the largest contributor to the uncertainty, fol-
lowed by the air density. The values presented here yield an expanded
uncertainty of 0.22% or 2.2 g for 1 kg of gas collected.
The uncertainty contribution due to condensation and icing of the
pipes can be minimised if we wait at least 20 min and clean the pipes
before reading the value of the scale. A 1 g spread as considered in
section 4 under the assumption of a rectangular distribution yields an
uncertainty contribution of 0.58 g (k ¼1) and leads to an expanded
uncertainty of 2.5 g (0.25%) for 1 kg of gas collected. The required

expanded uncertainty of 0.3% or less is therefore achieved. Measure-
ments in the field under real conditions validated some of the assump-
tions taken in the present uncertainty budget.

**7. Conclusion**

The design of the HFTS and its associated gravimetric measuring
method have been presented in this paper. Experimental results ob-
tained with the HFTS under laboratory conditions with cold nitrogen gas
at  40 �C to mimic real fill conditions in a hydrogen refuelling station
showed varying temperature and scale reading profiles. Condensation
on the HFTS leads to a change in mass over time of up to 7 g, which is not
negligible compared to the minimum quantity of 1 kg to be weighed
during field-testing. A complete uncertainty budget has been presented
and we obtained an expanded measuring uncertainty for the HFTS of
0.25%. The results presented in this paper can serve as a guide for future
designs of similar field testing instruments based on the gravimetric
principle.
